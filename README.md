# Azure Custom Vision Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **Microsoft Azure's Custom Vision service** to build and deploy an image classification model. Azure Custom Vision enables developers to easily train and deploy machine learning models for specific visual recognition tasks â€” all without needing deep expertise in AI or computer vision.

## ðŸ’¡ What is Azure Custom Vision?

Azure Custom Vision is part of Azure's Cognitive Services suite. It allows you to:

- Upload and label images via a web interface or API
- Train custom image classification or object detection models
- Evaluate model performance with built-in analytics
- Export models for offline use or deploy them via APIs or containers

## ðŸ”§ How Azure Helps in Building Custom Vision Projects

- **No-Code UI**: Easily train models through the Custom Vision portal without writing code.
- **Quick Training**: Leverages pre-trained models and transfer learning for faster, more accurate results.
- **REST API Access**: Integrate your trained models into mobile or web apps with simple REST APIs.
- **Deployment Options**: Export models for iOS, Android, TensorFlow, ONNX, or Docker containers.
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Hosted on Microsoft Azure for enterprise-level reliability and performance.
